00:00:00 Broadcasting live from warm sunny Colorado
00:06:20 Are you watching what David Sinclair is exploring? How about Aubrey de Grey with SENS Foundation?
00:09:46 What is the status of the side chains to build across chain dApps. We are really missing out massive dApp ecosystem that doesn't take Cardano seriously, i.e. tiny TVL comparison: Solana, Avalanche
00:12:32 Is Vasil short for vaseline because it will make everything smoother?
00:13:05 What do you think about the EU possibly banning POW? Will Bitcoin and Ethereum take a hit?
00:20:15 So how many more years are you going to drag on with your vaporware project publishing more and more useless papers before going to prison? 7 days wait time for your DEX btw

00:22:19 Why is Hedera so much better? Did you read their whitepaper?
00:22:37 What do you think of the current congestion status on Cardano? Do you believe right now the parameters are adjusted so that it can smoothly run until the next scalability update?
00:25:10 Would you ever consider writing a book? And what would it involve?
00:30:52 I would want to hear your thoughts on the future of smartphone software? Will we see non-proprietary OS's becoming popular? Would be good if had "Linux" of smartphone.

00:42:21 Is there a place in Cardano for music makers?
00:43:52 Why if you're a huge proponent of FOSS do you use an OS like Windows?
00:45:35 Favorite cigar?
00:47:36 Have you read The Changing World Order by Ray Dalio?
00:48:19 Have you read his book Principles?
00:48:44 It is also frustrating that such powerful hardware like new M1 chip PC's will be so hard to get open-source OS's due to proprietary politics by Apple.
00:51:19 Any WASM coming to the stack?
00:52:45 â€‹Is there any possibility that a language like Reach will come to Cardano? it's a chain-agnostic high level language. I did a bit of work with it on Algorand, looks really promising!

01:01:14 Do you or will you use Starlink for your ranch in WY? I live in Berthoud, CO and am expected to receive mine next month.
